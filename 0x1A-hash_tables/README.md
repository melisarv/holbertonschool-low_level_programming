# Project: 0x1A-hash_tables

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand a HashTable Data Structure, hash function, hash table

## Requirements
## C
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* It is allowed to use the C standard library.
* The prototypes of all the functions should be included in the header file called hash_tables.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-hash_table_create.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* hash_tables.h - header file
* 0-hash_table_create.c - function that creates a hash table
* 1-djb2.c - hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm
* 2-key_index.c - function that gives you the index of a key
* 3-hash_table_set.c - function that adds an element to the hash table
* 4-hash_table_get.c - function that retrieves a value associated with a key
* 5-hash_table_print.c - function that prints a hash table
* 6-hash_table_delete.c - function that deletes a hash table
