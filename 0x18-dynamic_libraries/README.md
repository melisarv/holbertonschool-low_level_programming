# Project: 0x18-dynamic_libraries

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it.

## Requirements
## C
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
* The prototypes of all the functions should be included in the header file called lists.h

##BASH
* All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
* All files must be executable

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-print_dlistint.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* holberton.h - header file
* libholberton.so - dynamic library file
* 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh - script that creates a dynamic library

## Authors

* Melisa Rojas
