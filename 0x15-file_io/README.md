# Project: 0x15-file_io

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand file descriptors, how to create, open, close, read and write files.

## Requirements
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc.. is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _ putchar
* The prototypes of all the functions and prototype of the function _ putchar should be included in header file called holberton.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-read_text.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* 0-read_textfile.c - reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output
* 1-create_file.c - creates a file
* 2-append_text_to_file.c - appends text at the end of file
* 3-cp.c - copies the content of a file to another file
