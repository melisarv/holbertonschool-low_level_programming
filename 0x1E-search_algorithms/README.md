# Project: 0x1E-search_algorithms

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand:

* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Contents

* search_algos.h: header file
* 0-linear.c: function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
* 1-binary.c: function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
* 2-O: the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n
* 3-O: the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n
* 4-O: the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?
* 5-O: the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n
* 6-O: the space complexity of this function / algorithm?
