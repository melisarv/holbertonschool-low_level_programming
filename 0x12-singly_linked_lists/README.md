# Project: 0x12-singly_linked_lists

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand when, why and how to use linked lists.

## Requirements
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc.. is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _ putchar
* The prototypes of all the functions and prototype of the function _ putchar should be included in header file called lists.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-print_list.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* 0-print_list.c - prints all the elements of a list
* 1-list_len.c - returns the numbers of elements in a linked list
* 2-add_node.c - adds a new noode at the beginning of a list
* 3-add_node_end.c - adds a new node at the end of a list
* 4-free_list.c - frees a list
