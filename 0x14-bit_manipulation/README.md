# Project: 0x14-bit_manipulation

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.

## Requirements
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc.. is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _ putchar
* The prototypes of all the functions and prototype of the function _ putchar should be included in header file called holberton.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-binary_to_uint.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* 0-binary_to_uint.c - converts a binary number to an unsigned int
* 1-print_binary.c - prints the binary representation of a number
* 2-get_bit.c - returns the value of a bit at a given index
* 3-set_bit.c - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
* 4-clear_bit.c - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
* 5-flip_bits.c - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
