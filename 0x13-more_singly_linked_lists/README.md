# Project: 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand how to use linked lists.

## Requirements
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc.. is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _ putchar
* The prototypes of all the functions and prototype of the function _ putchar should be included in header file called lists.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic [main file name].c [function file name].c -o [object file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

gcc -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic 0-main.c 0-print_list.c -o a

./a

## Functions

* 0-print_listint.c - prints all the elements of a list and return the number of nodes
* 1-listint_len.c - returns the numbers of elements in a linked list
* 2-add_nodeint.c - adds a new noode at the beginning of a list
* 3-add_nodeint_end.c - adds a new node at the end of a list
* 4-free_listint.c - frees a list. Receives a pointer as parameter
* 5-free_listint2.c - frees a list. Receives a double pointer as parameter
* 6-pop_listint.c - deletes the head node of a linked list
* 7-get_nodeint.c - returns the nth node of a linked list
* 8-sum_listint.c - returns the sum of all the data (n) of a linked list
* 9-insert_nodeint.c - inserts a new node at a given position
* 10-delete_nodeint.c - deletes the node at index of a linked list
